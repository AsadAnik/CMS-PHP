# Blog Content Management System with PHP

I have created a sample with php for cms. Those who wish may take it and continue to develop themselves. <br>
It is now at the basic level. <br>

### Setup
Create a MySQL database with the name you specified in db.php <br>
Create users, posts, comments, users_online, categories and roles tables in this database. <br>

### Advice to those who want to contribute.
1- To make the web page completely dynamic.<br>
2- Add theme<br>
3- Remove single page design.<br>

Don't forget to change db.php
